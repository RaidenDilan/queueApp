### Using this Angular Gulp Setup

To get started you first need to run:

```sh
$ npm i && bower i
```

You must have gulp installed on your machine, otherwise this app won't work. If you don't have it installed in terminal type:

```sh
$ gulp install
```
Add -g for global installing

```sh
$ npm install -g gulp
```
####OR
```sh
$ sudo npm install -g gulp
```

### Using the app

To use the app you must Register as a new user and login in order to get full access to the app.

###Creating a new submission

The user can create a new submission by clicking on the **New Submission** tab in the nav bar.

From here the user has to choose a **service**, **category** and fill in the rest of the form with the person's **title**, **firstname** and **lastname**.


###Checking your submission in the queue list
After submitting the form the users can check where they sit on the queue list by going to the **Submissions** tap in the nav bar.

###Problems

Have a problem with the category radio buttons. When styling them to look like a button the form won't submit the category values. So I've left it as a normal radio button.
